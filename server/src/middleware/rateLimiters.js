// express-rate-limit was already a dependency but wasn't wired up
// anywhere — meaning /auth/login, /auth/forgot-password, and
// /auth/reset-password had zero rate limiting of their own. auth.service.js
// already locks an ACCOUNT after 5 failed attempts (see
// MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS), but that's per-account — nothing stopped someone
// from hammering different usernames/emails from one IP, or spamming the
// forgot-password endpoint to mass-trigger reset emails.

// IP is far more than a real person signing up once will ever need.
//
// windowMs is an hour rather than the 15 minutes used above because signup
// is a once-ever action, not a repeated one — there's no legitimate reason
// to need a 6th attempt soon after 5 failures.
